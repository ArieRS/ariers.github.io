## Welcome On My Personal Homepage

I am a lecturer at the State Polytechnic of Malang. My research interests include machine learning and computer vision. I am currently enrolled in a PhD program at the Kyushu Institute of Technology in Japan. My research concerns low-resource computing, with a particular focus on reservoir computing.
