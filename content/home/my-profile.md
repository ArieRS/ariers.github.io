## Welcome On My Personal Homepage

Hi, my name is Arie Rachmad Syulistyo.
I am a lecturer at the State Polytechnic of Malang. I obtained my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Brawijaya University, and my Master’s degree in Computer Science from the University of Indonesia, under the supervision of Prof. Wisnu Djatmiko.
In 2005, I earned my Doctoral degree from the Kyushu Institute of Technology, supervised by Prof. Hakaru Tamukoh and Assoc. Prof. Yuichiro Tanaka. Currently, I am continuing my research as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Kyushu Institute of Technology.
My research interests include Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision.
